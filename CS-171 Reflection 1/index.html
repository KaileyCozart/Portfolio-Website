                        &ldquo;The people who build the technology are, 99 percent of the time, not in the country where the technology is going
                        to be used&hellip; which means they often miss the contextual details, such as infrastructure and
                        literacy, that are vital to building useful technology,&rdquo; points out Anahi Ayala Iacucci, an
                        innovation advisor at Internews, a non-profit that teaches people about media in developing countries.
                        <a href="#sources">[1]</a> Today, there is a huge demand for people to work in the tech industry in economically underprivileged
                        places around the world, but there is no one to fill the need, and not enough people to teach students
                        to fill that need.
                </p class="leftAlign">
                <p class="leftAlign">
                        Though it might not seem that there is any need for tech professionals in developing countries, the lives of individuals
                        and communities could be, and are being, changed by technology. First of all, if someone in a developing
                        country can learn how to code, they can support themselves and their families. For example, in Ghana,
                        the need for programmers was so great that programmers, on average, would get paid 10 times the amount
                        that a policeman or nurse would. <a href="#sources">[2]
                        </a> Secondly, technology can transform communities in these countries.
                        For example, in Kenya, SokoniSMS64 uses SMS to transfer exact information about wholesale crop sales
                        so that farmers can negotiate deals and spend less time traveling to markets. <a href="#sources">[3]</a> The &ldquo;iCow
                        from M-Farm&rdquo; app tracks each cow&rsquo;s gestation period so that herds can be efficiently
                        expanded, and the Tanzanian SMS-based app, Tigo Kilimo, provides weather information and agricultural
                        advice to help small farms. <a href="#sources">[3]</a> Likewise, initiatives like the Polaris Project have used data to
                        map anti-human-trafficking hotlines to help victims, and mobile health technologies like &ldquo;Malaria
                        No More&rdquo; tackle the spread of Malaria through mobile technology. 
                        <a href="#sources">[3]</a> The list goes on and on,
                        but the point is the same; the creative use of technology can be used to help people anywhere in
                        the world - not just in developed, first-world countries.

                <p class="leftAlign">
                        There are a variety of factors that are preventing people in developing countries from becoming involved in the tech industry.
                        First of all, programming requires you to have the ability to read, and there are high illiteracy
                        rates in developing nations. <a href="#sources">[4]</a> Also, because there are so few programmers, there is not a good
                        community for them to learn from. Because of this, &ldquo;They fail to make a connection to the future
                        of the course they are studying&hellip; The future appears to be dark.&rdquo; <a href="#sources">[5]</a> Also, because mobile
                        devices are so popular, some students have only had experience working with mobile devices and not
                        computers <a href="#sources">[5]</a>. Furthermore, there are not enough good teachers, and universities with qualified teachers
                        are often too expensive for most students to pay for. <a href="#sources">[2]</a> Also, many individuals that are well-educated
                        leave developing countries and never come back, leaving the uneducated and underprivileged behind
                        to fend for themselves. As a result of these factors, there are few people involved in the tech industry
                        in developing countries.
                </p class="leftAlign">
                <p class="leftAlign">
                        While the factors that prevent people from learning about technology in developing nations may seem insurmountable, there
                        are some things that are being done and that can be done to help involve these individuals to become
                        involved at the tech innovation table. For example, one of the greatest barriers in developing countries
                        is the fact that it is difficult to give children and adults a good education. By focusing on educating
                        individuals in developing countries, these individuals could learn how to create things that could
                        help their communities. For example, CodersTrust identifies promising programming candidates and
                        gives students microloans at monthly increments and, as students pass online courses, they are paid
                        more. <a href="#sources">[6]</a> Likewise, Making Ghanaian Girls Great (MGCubed) is the first interactive, distance learning
                        project where solar-powered computers allow students to participate in interactive, real-time lessons.
                        <a href="#sources">[7]</a>
                        One of the ways that people in our communities can help is to give financially or become involved
                        in these kinds of projects. You can also visit sites like <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/" 
                        target="blank"><u>Global Citizen</u></a>, which was created to spread
                        awareness about the struggles that people in developing countries have. <a href="#sources">[8]</a> Another very important
                        thing that we can do is to be involved in raising awareness for what technology can do to change
                        the lives of people in developing countries. By making people in our communities more aware of the
                        potential that tech has in decreasing poverty, we can work together to create lasting projects that
                        won’t just feed people for a day, but for a lifetime.
