                            <h1 class="tag-title">Essay on <i>Through the Gates of Splendor</i></h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>&#34;I would gladly give my life for that tribe,&#34; wrote the faithful Pete Fleming, as cited in Elizabeth Elliot&#39;s creative, non-fiction book Through the Gates of Splendor. Five young missionaries, Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderian were willing to perish for the savage Auca Indians, but was this wise or reckless? By comparing and contrasting two different views, this essay will decide whether these missionaries&#39; lives and deaths were a &#34;tragedy or a triumph.&#34; <br /><br /><br />
Through the world&#39;s limited view of the situation, the youthful missionaries were foolish, ignorant people. The Aucas had an extensive history of brutal killing; for example, in 1541, Gonzalo Pizarro had been attacked by Indians near Auca territory while trying to find the Incas. Furthermore, Jesuit priest and first missionary to the Aucas, Pedro Suares, was killed by spears in 1667. Destroying and plundering Indian property from 1875-1925, ruthless rubber hunters stirred hatred in the Indians&#39; hearts toward the white men. Consequently, eleven Shell fuel workers were massacred in Arajuno during the years 1942 and 1943. Barely surviving a surprise Auca attack in 1947, the Swedish explorer Rolf Blomberg was ambushed while riding in a boat. In addition to these terrifying reports, there was an even more dismal example of Auca savagery that came from a young woman named Dayuma, who was an erstwhile Auca. When her family was murdered in a typical Auca feud, Dayuma narrowly escaped into friendly Quichua hands. Warning the missionaries, she said, &#34;Never, never trust them (the Aucas), they may appear to be friendly and then will turn around and kill.&#34; As a result of these horrendous tales, the world would definitely consider the missionaries&#39; plan to bring the good news of the Gospel to the Aucas as insane and reckless. <br /><br /><br />
Contrary to the world, the missionaries&#39; viewed their situation differently than most. Even though the men knew of the dangers of the fierce Aucas, they were willing to risk their lives in order to bring the Gospel to the lost Auca tribe. Prepared to sacrifice everything, Roger Youderian said, &#34;I will die to selfâ€¦ I will be alive unto God. That I may learn to love Him with my heart, soul, and body.&#34; Likewise, Nate Saint wrote that he was &#34;expendable for God,&#34; Pete Fleming was willing to &#34;live to the hilt&#34; for the Lord, and Ed McCully was willing, &#34;To live a life of reckless abandon for the Lord.&#34; Realizing that everyone saw the missionaries as fools, Jim Elliot stated that, &#34;He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.&#34; The world would say that these young men were fools; however, these men were actually brave warriors for Christ that were fulfilling their dream to tell the Gospel to those who had never been reached by the word of God. <br /><br /><br />
Should the missionaries have gone to the Aucas? The missionaries were certainly not perfect, and perhaps they should have asked for the guidance of more experienced missionaries. However, these men were certainly not like the delusional protagonist in Doris Lessing&#39;s &#34;Sunrise on the Veld,&#34; who would not ask his parents for advice. In contrast, these men were ready to die for their Savior&#39;s cause, even if they were young and perhaps too hasty. Nevertheless, &#34;God is God,&#34; and he uses flawed people to accomplish his perfect will. Though the world would see these missionaries as foolish youth and would have encouraged the men to give up, these incredulously wise and intelligent missionaries were true examples of sacrifice.

                            <h1 class="tag-title">Essay on <i>Robinson Crusoe</i></h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>&quot;They are not asham&#39;d to sin, and yet are asham&#39;d to repent,&quot; observes the wayward, yet honest, man in Daniel Defoe&#39;s novel, Robinson Crusoe, which was published in 1719 as the first English novel. By comparing different authors (Aesop, Defoe, Sophocles, Waring and the Bible), this essay will prove that all humans have the tendency to rebel against divine authority and virtue. <br /><br /><br />
	At the beginning of the novel, Crusoe is a young man that is neither grossly rich nor grossly poor. Crusoe lives, as Aesop would say, in the middle way of virtue. However, despite the warnings of his loving father, Crusoe desires for the &quot;superior fortunes&quot; of excess. Carelessly, he also desires excess freedom (in the form of seafaring), and begins to fill his mind with those &quot;aspiring thoughts that have since completed my ruin.&quot; Crusoe&#39;s sage father tries to warn his son saying that, &quot;If I did take that foolish step, God would not bless me.&quot; Despite such a caring warning, however, Crusoe rebels against his father&#39;s authority and the virtue of the middle way by running away to sea. <br /><br /><br />
Crusoe is warned many times to leave his vile seafaring life viz. he has &quot;mal de mer&quot; (seasickness), his ship founders in the sea, his captain friend compares him to Jonah and begs him to return home, and he is temporarily enslaved by the Moors. (Quite ironically, Crusoe is taken captive in his search for &quot;freedom&quot;!) As a result of these experiences, Crusoe makes multiple &quot;vows and resolutions&quot; to return home, but he does not fulfill them. Additionally, because of Crusoe&#39;s desire for excess riches, he gladly agrees to a &quot;secret proposal&quot; that involves illegally procuring slaves. After this, Crusoe finds himself shipwrecked on an island, alone and in total isolation for twenty-eight years. Building a civilization from nothing, Crusoe becomes his own doctor, pastor, and carpenter. Defoe, who lived during the nature-despising Neoclassical Age, seems to be teaching readers that when one rebels against the divine order of things, the consequence is returning to the primitive. <br /><br /><br />
	When all seems lost for Crusoe, he finds the solution to his desires for excess freedom and riches. Crusoe experiences two events that shape his life: a giant earthquake, and a grave sickness that gives way to a horrifying delusion telling Crusoe, &quot;All these things have not brought thee to repentance.&quot; From this point on, Crusoe realizes the &quot;stupidity of soul&quot; in all of mankind compared to God&#39;s sovereignty, and knows that man should be &quot;content to fill a little space if thou be glorified.&quot; He realizes that man is &quot;striving after wind&quot; (Ecclesiastes 2:26) when &quot;Man desires to be more than man, to rule his world for himself&quot; (Sophocles). In light of this, Crusoe finds the solution to his desires for excess riches and freedom in God&#39;s &quot;secret, overruling decree&quot; that &quot;sees how the world is ruled&quot; (Sophocles). <br /><br /><br />
	In the end, Crusoe concludes that God must be the solution to all problems in this broken world because God created the world. Thus, Crusoe decides that &quot;God had appointed all this to befall me.&quot; After returning to England, however, he becomes consumed with excess riches once again and loses his focus on God. At the end of the story, Defoe is once again pointing out the human nature of people to chase after worldly, material things. Defoe, who died hiding from an unpaid landlord, knew how hard it was to trust in God rather than material wealth. Despite this, however, he desired for his readers to make a &quot;religious application&quot; to their lives and to &quot;Call on Me (God) in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you&quot; (Psalm 50:15).

I always saw my knowledge quite advanced.<br /><br /><br />

Not even those with wisdom so profound,<br />
Could change the blunder of my fabled might.<br /> 
In morning, noon, and night I pranced around;<br />
Deception wrapped deceit around me tight. <br /><br /><br />

Still grounded deeply in my sin I was.<br />
But when my situation caused me pain, <br />
There was no other answer for my plight!<br />
The truth had grasped me like a heavy chain.<br /><br /><br />

From my unkind delusions I was taught<br />
To always live with humble word and thought. <br /><br /><br />

                            <h1 class="tag-title">Optimist Essay Winner</h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>The winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, Colum McCann, once stated, &#34;I&#39;m not interested in blind optimism, but I&#39;m very interested in optimism that is hard-won.&#34;  Optimism. What is it? And why should optimism be our priority? According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, optimism is &#34;an inclination to put the most favorable construction upon actions and events;&#34;  this inclination to trust in the best, however, can be seen as either wretched ignorance or as an undeniable right. True optimism, &#34;the foundation of courage and true progress,&#34;  should be our greatest priority. Moreover, delusional, blind optimism should be replaced by true optimism - optimism based on reality. This dichotomy between blind optimism and real optimism is the key to discovering why optimism is of utmost importance. <br /><br /><br />
Jim Collins, an outstanding business consultant and author, explained the &#34;Stockdale Paradox&#34; in his book Good to Great. This paradox, named after Admiral Jim Stockdale of the United States Military, was illustrated by the capture of American troops in Vietnam. For eight long years, these prisoners were brutally mistreated. While some were depressed, others were optimistic; it was the optimistic ones &#34;who said, &#39;we&#39;re going to be out by Christmas.&#39; And Christmas would come and Christmas would go. Then they&#39;d say, &#39;we&#39;re going to be out by Easter.&#39; And Easter would come and Easter would goâ€¦ And they died of a broken heart.&#34;  After explaining this tragic example, Jim Collins explains the Stockdale Paradox, saying, &#34;You must retain faith that you will prevail in the endâ€¦ at the same time, you must confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever that may be.&#34;  As explained by Helen Keller, true optimism occurs when &#34;the outward world justifies my inward universe of good.&#34;  This kind of optimism, unlike blind optimism, is objective realism with a long-term, even eternal, scope; this sort of optimism ought to be a priority - for it always produces incredible strength to endure even the greatest trials and tribulations. <br /><br /><br />
Unfortunately, in many events, meaningful optimism is replaced with undiscerning, desperate optimism. This kind of optimism isn&#39;t dependent on facts, but rather trusts in uncertain presumptions. Because of its delusional assumptions, false optimism cannot be a true realism. A simple glance at the newspaper will expose delusional optimism. For example, nearly two thousand men, women, and children have been slaughtered in the last six months by ISIS as of December, 2014; the most recent of these victims was a Japanese Journalist, Kenji Koto. In Paris, France, citizens are still in shock after the shooting of twelve people at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on January 7, 2015. Moreover, on our own continent, school shootings and riots are a far too often occurrence. These examples seem to denote that, more often than not, false optimism can belong to &#34;a man who has never had much experience&#34;  with the morbid realities of our broken world. Furthermore, Helen Rowland stated, &#34;An optimist is merely an expressionist with his pockets full of money;&#34;  fake optimism is often dependent on one&#39;s circumstances. However, when a challenging situation occurs, a fake optimist&#39;s outward circumstances do not justify his delusion of well-being. There is no doubt that, throughout the years, many a false optimist has become a pessimist due to his circumstances; such cases were summarized by Paul Fussel when he lamented that &#34;I find nothing more depressing than optimism.&#34;  Avoiding false optimism is achieved by focusing one&#39;s prospects on both reality and hope. Therefore, finding true optimism should be a priority. <br /><br /><br />
	As Helen Keller wrote, &#34;The test of all beliefs is their practical effect in life.&#34;  False optimists will constantly be in danger of reckoning with reality - and having their hopes destroyed. In the end, only true optimists, those who have hopes based on objective reality, will be able to change this world, for &#34;the world&#39;s philosophersâ€¦ [are] optimists. So also are the men of action and achievement.&#34;  The illustrious American writer and professor at Harvard College, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was the epitome of scholastic achievement. In his poem &#34;The Psalm of Life,&#34; Longfellow stated that the goal of life is &#34;that each to-morrow find us farther than to-day.&#34;  In the end, by denying false optimism grounded in fallacies, true optimists will rise to the occasion and change this world. True optimists are those who will stand up for what they believe in and persevere with confidence, trusting in the triumph of good in the end. These optimists are our future writers, our future politicians, and our future scientists; these people will make optimism their priority - and change the world because of it.

                            <h1 class="tag-title">Essay on <i>Great Expectations</i></h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>&#34;I am disgusted with my calling and with my life!&#34; complains Pip in Charles Dickens&#39; novel, Great Expectations. Throughout his life, Pip makes the journey from childhood to adulthood by gaining the virtues of humbleness, correct affections, and gratitude. In the midst of his circumstances, Pip is hammered and heated until he is shaped into something useful. <br /><br /><br />
	People often replace humbleness with hubris, a god-like view of self. Shakespeare, an insightful observer of mankind who lived during the Victorian Age, wrote in Sonnet 62 that the &#34;sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye, and all my soul, and all my every part.&#34; Similarly, Sophocles knew that most people tend to think that they are the &#34;originator of their skill.&#34; Sophocles&#39; main character in &#34;Oedipus Rex&#34; displayed a hubris attitude, pridefully proclaiming that &#34;my throne and my power are supreme.&#34; Likewise, hundreds of years later in Rome, the ruler Julius Caesar believed that he was &#34;as constant as the North Star,&#34; and did not listen to the signs, omens, and portents of wise men like the Soothsayer and Artemidorus. Even his wife, Calpurnia, warned him that &#34;your wisdom is consumed in confidence.&#34; Unfortunately, Caesar did not heed the warnings of others and became nothing more than a &#34;bleeding piece of earth.&#34; The late Doris Lessing, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in literature, also illustrates hubris when her protagonist in &#34;Sunrise on the Veld&#34; believes that &#34;I contain the world&#34; and looks down on his parents, who he grudgingly describes as &#34;those frowsting sleepers.&#34; In the same way, Charles Dickens&#39; Pip is much like the boy on the veld, for he has a &#34;keen sense of incongruity&#34; with his mentor, Joe, who is a humble, uncommon man that respects his dreadful wife. Additionally, in Defoe&#39;s book, Robinson Crusoe, Crusoe does not listen to his loving father&#39;s wise advice: &#34;If I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me.&#34; Thus, Crusoe spends 28 years on an island - in total isolation from the civilized world. Similarly, Percy B. Shelly, who himself was an anarchist, wrote his poem &#34;Ozymandias&#34; about Ramses II of Egypt; he points out that &#34;nothing beside remains&#34; of Ramses&#39; erstwhile power and hubris. All of these foolish, yet common, men were not humble enough to listen to others; they were certainly not &#34;content to fill a little space if thou be glorified (Waring).&#34; On the other hand, Jim Elliot, the missionary to the Aucas (&#34;savages&#34;), was willing to die for what the world saw as &#34;lesser breeds without the law.&#34; The Bible shows the ultimate example of humbleness in Matthew 20:27-28, when Jesus, the Son of God, washes the feet of filthy sinners. Humbleness produces uncommonness, but when readers choose to replace humbleness with hubris, they will undoubtedly suffer a &#34;steepling plunge to earth (Sophocles).&#34; <br /><br /><br />
	In a broken world, gratitude is often replaced with discontentment. For example, Pip, at the beginning of Great Expectations, was chided for ingratitude. Later, when Pip goes to Satis, or &#34;Enough,&#34; House, he gains a desire for more than what he has been given. No longer desiring virtue, Pip chases Estella, a cruel girl who warns him, &#34;I have no heart.&#34; Likewise, Defoe&#39;s Crusoe desires &#34;superior fortunes&#34; of excess; he wants to rebel against divine authority to gain what will not fulfill him. Jason Lehman remarks in his poem &#34;Present Tense&#34; that &#34;my life was over, and I never got what I wanted.&#34; Though Dickens, Defoe, and Lehman clearly show man&#39;s tendency to &#34;chase after the wind (Ecclesiastes)&#34;, they give no solution to this enormous problem. On the other hand, Longfellow, in his &#34;Psalm of Life&#34; attempts to give a solution by saying, &#34;be a hero in the strife.&#34; Longfellow, however, does not tell readers how to be heros. Similarly, Aristotle, in his poem called &#34;The Golden Mean,&#34; states that virtue (staying between Scylla and Charybdis) is the key. After all, &#34;he who holds fast the Golden Mean and lives contentedly between feels not the wants that pinch the poor or plagues that haunt the rich man&#39;s door.&#34; Sadly, Aristotle does not give a complete solution, for none can live perfectly in between the vices of excess and defect. In contrast, the Christian poem writer, Anna Waring, advises readers to have &#34;a mind to blend with outward life while keeping at Thy side.&#34; Such a mind can only be given by the Grace of God. Contentment is about trusting in God with your situation and knowing that &#34;all things work together for good (Romans 8:28).&#34; When readers do this, they can have the same experience as the writer of Philippians, who says in verse 4:11, &#34;I have learned in whatever situation to be content.&#34; <br /><br /><br />
	Unfortunately, inordinate, misplaced affections often replace one&#39;s love for God. Likewise, Pip has &#34;blind devotion&#34; to someone who is &#34;not worth gaining over.&#34; Though ridiculed for his &#34;coarse hands and thick boots,&#34; Pip still desires Estella. Biddy, a close friend of Pip, gives Pip a warning when she asks, &#34;aren&#39;t you happier as you are?&#34; Even Herbert, another close friend of Pip, asks Pip &#34;can&#39;t (you) forget about her?&#34; Similarly, Crusoe is a slave to his love for &#34;superior fortunes,&#34; and even illegally sells slaves for more money! Instead of loving things of the world, however, the Bible calls readers to love God first, others second, and yourself last. 1 Corinthians 13 showcases true love by saying, &#34;love is patient &#8211; it holds no record of wrongs.&#34; Joe shows true love when he accepts Pip back like the Prodigal Son. Likewise, Portia, the wife of Brutus, shows true love and care for her husband when she says &#34;make me acquainted to your cause of grief.&#34; In the same light, Jim Elliot shows devotion to God, saying &#34;he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.&#34; True love is defined by God, who created us and died for us and allows us to say, &#34;Father, I know that all my life is portioned out for me (Waring).&#34; <br /><br /><br />
	Man has a tendency to &#34;construe things after his own fashion (Shakespeare),&#34; causing people to replace the virtues of humbleness, appropriate love, and gratitude with hubris, inordinate love, and unthankfulness. Pip was caught in the &#34;forged hooks&#34; of vice &#34;in the bay where all men ride&#34; because he was common - even despite his efforts to be uncommon. By being pounded and shaped like a piece of metal, however, he was shaped into something better. In classic literature, writers are &#34;brutally honest&#34; about vices and virtues. Unfortunately, many classics can only show the problem, not the solution. The Bible, on the other hand, gives the real solution, viz., if one chooses vice, he will be unfulfilled and in isolation (much like Robinson Crusoe). If one follows virtue, however, he will be joyful and fulfilled. Virtue does not come with age, or even experience, but is instead a characteristic of God&#39;s grace.

                            <p>Drowning in a vat of boiling oil, <br />
You&#39;ll regret your scorching, worthless toil; <br />
Your sun-bleached bones will lie for years <br />
Without loved ones to mourn with tears. <br />
Your death will be a mystery, <br />
Throughout the ages &#8211; history. <br />
But only you will know your fate; <br />
You&#39;ll suffer through my ugly hate, <br />
For shells, like knives, will pierce your skin<br />
As punishment for your great sin. <br />
&#34;My sin?&#34; you&#39;ll ask as if surprised, <br />
And then you&#39;ll realize I survived <br />
Your past abuses and mistakes. <br />
At the sight of you my wrath awakes, <br />
And I grasp my weapon &#8211; a million stakes. <br />
That beautiful blood and gruesome gore, <br />
Akin to ancient, cruel folk lore, <br />
Will ne&#39;er be told to youthful ears. <br />
My friend, it&#39;s time to face your fears, <br />
Impending death now nears. <br />

                            <h1 class="tag-title">Essay on <i>Screwtape Letters</i></h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Amid the horrendous backdrop of World War II, the British novelist, lecturer, and Christian apologist, Clive Staples Lewis, published one of his greatest novels, The Screwtape Letters, in 1942. However, instead of writing about political ideals, war plans, or national struggles, Lewis wrote about the most basic struggle of all. This struggle, the kind that is fought by every human being, was Lewis&#39; greatest concern. Using the viewpoint of a demon, the author fashioned thirty-one letters under the name of Screwtape. In his letters, the demon, Screwtape, addresses his young nephew, Wormwood, who does not fully understand the art of tempting &#34;	the disgusting little human vermin&#34;	 (Lewis 7). Christian readers from around the world can learn to combat sin more effectively by understanding the temptations of the devil and striving to be the opposite of what a demon like Screwtape would want them to be. Though Screwtape writes concerning a variety of topics, an overarching topic that he often references is love. By observing God&#39;s love for man, human love, and self-love, Lewis explores the subject of love itself. <br /><br /><br />
	The first of these types of love, self-love, is brought to Wormwood&#39;s attention as an excellent method of temptation. In Screwtape&#39;s twenty-sixth letter to Wormwood, the senior tempter discusses the topic of self-forgetfulness. The goal, he says, is to &#34;	teach a man to surrender benefits not that others may be happy in having them but that he may be unselfish in forgoing them&#34;	 (Lewis 141). Explaining this further, Screwtape tells Wormwood to bring about a &#34;	Generous Conflict Illusion&#34;	 (Lewis 143). This illusion, Screwtape says, will result in one person making a sacrifice that they think the other person wants. In reality, the other person does not truly want the &#34;	gift,&#34;	 and the &#34;	selfless&#34;	 person ends up feeling offended, angry, and self-righteous (Lewis 143). These temptations, though justified under the guise of &#34;	unselfishness,&#34;	 are often self-serving displays of supposed righteousness and humility. Humans are tricked into thinking that they are being &#34;	unselfish&#34;	 when they do things just for the sake of being a &#34;	good person.&#34;	  By doing these righteous deeds, they become delusionally confident in themselves, while, in the meantime, they end up not caring about the other person at all (Lewis 144). Instead of being centered around their own &#34;	goodness,&#34;	 as Lewis&#39; demons would desire them to do, readers are moved to follow the example given in the Bible: &#34;	-Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others&#34;	 (New International Version, Phil. 2.3-4). True selflessness, Lewis seems to say, is not only about what you do, but also about why you do it. If we focus on loving others, we can prevent ourselves from selfish self-love. However, this kind of love is not the only kind of love that Lewis&#39; demon writes about. <br /><br /><br />
	Observing a different aspect of love, Screwtape writes his eighteenth letter on the subject of love between two human beings. In order to confuse and ruin relationships, Screwtape tells Wormwood to make the humans believe, &#34;	-&#39;being in love&#39; is the only respectable ground for marriage- a marriage which does not do so is no longer binding&#34;	 (Lewis 93). Moreover, while disdaining the idea that &#34;	the good of one self is to be the good of another&#34;	 (Lewis 94), Screwtape encourages readers to avoid the fake selflessness that passionate love can bring. He tells Wormwood that people should be led to focus on the emotion of love, instead of the actions that love brings (Lewis 94-5). The words of &#34;	the Enemy&#39;s philosophy&#34;	 (Lewis 94) give readers advice saying, &#34;	That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh&#34;	 (Gen. 2.24). Love is about acting out of devotion to your other half; it is about loving the other person as much as you love yourself. Disdaining the fact that God&#39;s view of love is a love of actions, Screwtape moves readers to escape the half-truths of the demons and encourages readers to stay faithful to God&#39;s purpose for human love. <br /><br /><br />
	Unsurprisingly, Screwtape is not only concerned about self-love and human love, but also with God&#39;s love for man. In his nineteenth letter to Wormwood, Screwtape remarks on this aspect of love. As a demon, Screwtape cannot possibly imagine that God might truly love man, stating, &#34;	He must have some real motive for creating them and taking so much trouble about them&#34;	 (Lewis 100). Even though he knows how to confuse men, Screwtape himself is confused when it comes to understanding God. Being a demon, Screwtape wonders, &#34;	What does He stand to make out of them?&#34;	 (Lewis 100). Because he is unwilling to believe that God possesses true love, Screwtape concludes, saying, &#34;	We know that he cannot really love: nobody can: it doesn&#39;t make sense. If we could only find what He is really up to!&#34;	 (Lewis 101). With this in mind, Screwtape tells Wormwood that human love is not necessarily bad or good. Screwtape does, however, tell Wormwood that it is important to make his subject stumble by drawing him away from the realization of the love of God: &#34;	Nothing matters at all except- to move a particular patient at a particular moment nearer to the Enemy or nearer to us.&#34;	 In the end, Screwtape is unable to comprehend the unending love of God that is described when the Bible says, &#34;	But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness&#34;	 (Ps. 86.15). The same love that confounds the demons encourages Christians and draws them closer to their Creator, whose Holy Word says, &#34;	For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life&#34;	 (John 3.16).  <br /><br /><br />
	While exploring the topics of self-love, love between two humans, and God&#39;s love for man, Screwtape gives readers an example of how not to live. In conclusion, Lewis&#39; demonic protagonist teaches readers to defend themselves against temptation and gives them encouragement in God&#39;s undying love.

                            <h1 class="tag-title">Essay on the Application of Ecclesiastes</h1>
                            <hr />
                            <p>As a forgiven child of God, I have found that life is much more complex than I would like to think. Like many others, I fight to control my life. After studying the book of Ecclesiastes, I have begun to realize the extent and impact of my desire to be able to control my life and my future. <br /><br /><br />
	When I was homeschooled, my parents would always lecture me about the importance of having good character. For example, we would talk about the negative consequences that occurred when people were unwise. As I grew older, I began to believe that bad circumstances could easily be avoided by being wise and working hard. This frame of mind is, in fact, quite grounded in my habits. Not more than a few years ago, a realization occurred when I fell very ill for no apparent reason. When I was admitted to the hospital, and was told that I might have Leukemia, I was confused. Something bad had happened despite my good character, and now that thing threatened both my current life and my future plans. Though I eventually recovered, and my illness was not cancer-related, the experience made me angry that I hadn&#39;t figured out how to control my life and stop bad things from happening. I was frustrated. I wanted to be able to get leverage by being wise, and I assumed that, by being wise, I could control my future. Despite my attempts at being wise in how I interact with others, I have recently struggled to maintain good relationships with other people, especially my immediate family. I still find myself believing that I can control my life completely by working hard and succeeding in what I do, whether that be at school or on the job.  <br /><br /><br />
	If I continue on the road that I am on, I will still be confused an angry 10 to 15 years from now. I will be bankrupt in my spiritual life and upset with God because His will may not be lining up with my desires. As a student or employee, I will be anxious and nervous because I will think that my future salary, success, and opportunities depend solely on what I do. My life and my goals, rather than the needs and cares of my friends and family, will be my priority. The belief that I can control my life will cause me frustration when my parents, siblings, or spouse get in the way of my plans. In a word, I will be too focused on controlling my life; my &#34;sandcastle&#34; that I build will not last for long, and seemingly uncalled-for trials will destroy me. <br /><br /><br />
	Ecclesiastes 3:9-15 talks about the fact that God is in control. We struggle to see God&#39;s plan, but His plan will work itself out in His time. Moreover, Ecclesiastes 5:18-20 tells readers to enjoy God&#39;s gifts instead of pining over their struggle to have the &#34;perfect life&#34; that they desire. Finally, Ecclesiastes 12:12-14 talks about how we should lean on God&#39;s perfect wisdom rather than our manufactured wisdom. These verses show my struggle because they are brutally honest about the fact that I cannot see God&#39;s plan, and that my true focus should be shifted onto God&#39;s gifts and wisdom. <br /><br /><br />
	The alternative suggested by Solomon is to replace my wisdom and my control with God&#39;s wisdom and God&#39;s control. In Ecclesiastes 8:15, Solomon states that man should fear God and realize that he cannot even understand God&#39;s ways. Ecclesiastes 2:24-25 says that all man has (his life, his wealth, and his opportunities) come from God. These passages show that the unexpected and inconvenient will occur, and that our only hope for a reliable future is through Christ and not ourselves. When I became ill, I was focusing on my lack of control, rather than God&#39;s absolute control. Likewise, when I interact with my family, I am focused on my own wisdom, rather than God&#39;s wisdom. If I were to use Solomon&#39;s advice, I would have leaned on Christ when things went terribly wrong. I would have trusted that God has a bigger, overall picture that I don&#39;t fully understand. Moreover, in regards to how I currently treat my family, I would realize that even my perfect actions and words cannot change relationships, rather, God is the one who changes people and relationships. I would stop trying to solve things my way and start trying to surrender my control to God&#39;s will. <br /><br /><br />
	If I were to trust in God&#39;s control rather than my own control, I would need to form new habits. First of all, I would need to change the way that I viewed God&#39;s power and control. By making it a habit to thank God every day for whatever His perfect will had done, my trust in God&#39;s control would be strengthened. Second, I would need to change the way that I viewed life&#39;s achievements. By making it a habit to read the Bible and enjoy God&#39;s passing gifts, I would see life as both precious and fleeting. Finally, it would be important to surround myself with people who make it a goal to view God&#39;s wisdom above their own. By making these things habits, I would eventually cultivate my character and become a more faithful and joyful person years down the road. If I followed Solomon&#39;s advice, I would have faith in God&#39;s plans, despite my inability to understand God&#39;s perfect will. Instead of being an anxious, nervous student or employee, I would be a joyful person who would be willing to deal with the circumstances, no matter how stark they were. Finally, I would be a more loving child, sibling, and spouse because I would realize the value and minuteness of the time I have here on earth. One day, I would be a faithful, joyful, Christian who would be intent on doing God&#39;s will. One day, with Christ&#39;s help, I will be a more trusting, faithful, and joyful child of God.

                            <p>Princely mind of potent power, <br />
Probe the pagan, priestly passions; <br />
Find your peace in pleasure&#39;s promise, <br />
Follow what your fierce soul fashions. <br /><br /><br />

Master of delusive dogmas, <br />
Heed the hollow, heavy hours,  <br />
Hear the horrid, hateful warnings<br />
Dark&#39;ning death&#39;s door, dark and dour.  <br /><br /><br />

Pallid, pale, poor heart of hubris <br />
Fearf&#39;lly face your fate so fev&#39;rish! <br />
Sense the spirit see the coming <br />
Afterlife of acrid anguish! <br /><br /><br />

Life is lived with loss and longing &#8211;  <br />
Begging for belov&#39;d belonging. <br />
Ponder, pause, and pray prolonging <br />
Dear, delightful days still dawning. <br /><br /><br />
